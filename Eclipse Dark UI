Eclipse Dark UI

Since you already have the com.github.colortheme already in the drop ins folder, you don't have to download the dark them UI again 
since it's already installed.

What you have to do, if you decide to create a new workspace, it's to go on Windows -> Preferences 
-> click on the Apperance tab but NOT the arrow -> Dark -> drop down the Apperance List -> Color Theme -> Sublime Text 2.

If for some reason or in the near future you have a new work laptop or desktop and you want to change the UI to dark, 
there's a youtube video explaning perfectlywhat you need to do in order to get the whole UI dark.
