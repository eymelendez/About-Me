Well, you may have noticed that i've been a little busy with college work and may have not uploaded much over the weeks
or some days in between. Obviously since it's almost finals week, they have gave out some additional homework to give us a little 
more pressure before we actual have the final exams and what not. For some reason this semester has been pretty rough, and i thought the 
others were bad. The reason for that it's that it's hard for me to give all of my attention to all the class when one class in particular
has quizzes every single day when get on class meetings, yes, even after a partial exam. It's crazy cuz I also have a life you know and
not to mention that I have other classes too. But I'm just glad that this semester is actually getting over with.
