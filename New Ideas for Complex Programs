I've been practicing some of the program challenges on the book after I finsihed all the C++ classes for good and have 
looked for feedback on how to study more.

As people say, for some careers, you are a student for life which personally I don't mind since I like to learn 
something new everyday but it's been a little struggling since i also have to keep up with my courses while I self-study
material that I have an interest in. Guess I'll have to look for more info on what to do.

I want to practice more complex programming. Learn how to document the code more than just writing code and nobody
uderstanding but at the same time, time itself is limited.
