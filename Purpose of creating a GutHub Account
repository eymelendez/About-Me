There's a couple of reasons on why I decided to create a GitHub Account. One thing is I've found
useful references to get "unstuck" on i project for my course and assignments that the Professor said. Another
thing was that it was required by the Internet Programming Course. But as time passed on since i started the University,
i was looking for a place to store all of my coding done for the courses and from me personally in case that the computer dies 
or malfunctions. This way not only do I have a "backup" in case there was a full code or code snippet that I did, but I might be 
able to contribute on other people's projects or they can help me. Plus, a dear friend of mine said that this can be used as
a "Programmers Portfolio" or "Programmers Notebook" as they say.

I have to say that I'm still relatively new to this website so I still got a lot to learn... and oh boy is it a lot. Since 
it was only being used as a way for the professor to see the files and grade my projects, i did thought at the time how or what exactly is it used for. I feel that I've only scratched the 
surface of the programming languages that I've been working on.
