I've been thinking about uploading my work of Java Programming since I'm taking a class that mainly focuses 
on Java Programming.

I think it's a good way to way to maintain the version control of the projects sinces I have a tendency of having 
multiple versions of the same program until I get it right and upload the oficial version.

Then again I don't mind sharing my works and ideas but since it's a Public Repository I may have to start testing the
private repositories and see how it goes, or maybe let certain people that I trust.
