# About-Me
Personal Notes, Discussion, Etc.

This section of my GitHub account will be used as a "discussion board" about technology, coding , my progress in coding languages
or just general stuff that I find interesting.

Also if you have any ideas for me to practice coding or better yet, if you need help, don't forget to comment me and let me
know if i can help you on anything.
