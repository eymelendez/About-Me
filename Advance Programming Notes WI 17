Here are going to be the notes I took for the course of Advance Programming as a way to study the material.

NOTE TO VIEWER: The following notes may be subject to change.

Bytecode has an extension called .class

Primitive Data Types - int, char, doule byte

If you see something in uppercase, it's a class.

In a Switch, you can use int, char, string

In Java there's a new loop that is called for-each.

Primitive Dat Types can be defirent in C++ but in Java, everything is 4 bytes.

In Java it has to be explicitly with words.

In C++ you can say flag = 1; // 1 being the word true but in binary
In Java is exclusively true or false, no numbers.
